<h2>Group Purpose</h2>
<ol>
<li>Is to give an insight into Canadian life.
<li>To build a friendly community where you can ask and answer questions about Canadian life, settlement, education, health care, job search, and visa application.
<li>Even though the opinions shared are from personal experience and perspective, we will back it up with sources and facts, where ever applicable.
<li>To keep the group active, we encourage you all to ask as many questions as possible, with expectations that we will respond whenever we can :) (We are usually active between 3 pm and 11 pm EST and on weekends). Feel free to answer the questions that you're sure about.
</ol> 
<h2>Group Rules:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Firstly read all rules :)
<li>Always keep to the purpose of the group! Don’t share irrelevant messages about other topics.
<li>Don’t send content, information, or “news” that HASN’T been verified. If possible provide information along with the link where you found it.
<li>Please introduce yourself with few lines and your purpose of being in this group (this is the most important rule so that we can eliminate the lurkers and reduce the group to genially interested participants. Anyone joining without an intro will be removed after 24 hours)
<li>Keep in mind that your words can be interpreted in multiple ways.
<li>Any person posting/discussing away from the purpose of the group will be removed under admins' discretion.
<li>For all the marketers. Beware we know how to spot you :)
<li>Please let us know if someone is contacting you privately for any marketing purposes, we will take action to maintain the sanctity of the group
<li>Respect each other and don't get too bothered with people asking about the same topic.
<li>Don't worry if people are leaving the group. Everyone has a different set of expectations :) and we can only reach a few.
</ol>
